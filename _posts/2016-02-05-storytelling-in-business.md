In Jack and the beanstalk Jack and his mom own a cow, it was a nice cow but it was all they had, when Jack was out to sell their cow, instead of selling it for gold, he sells it for a handful of beans, beans that were supposed to be magical. For me that's where the story ends. Yes, eventually Jack grows the beanstalk and robs the giant, gives all the stolen gold to his mom and then he kills the giant with the help of his ax. But all that stuff is irrelevant. The point is that he didn't trade the cow for money or a sure thing, he traded the cow for a chance at something great. He trade it for opportunity.

> Storytelling is a narrative that engages its listeners through psychological realism.

Tales of stories mixed with education are not mere coincidence, stories are better understood than plain facts, they are easier to remember and are more encouraging to share. Jeremy Hsu in his article "[The secret of storytelling](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-secrets-of-storytelling/){:target="_blank"}” states that scientists are starting to agree that stories have a powerful and universal appeal that are tied to the neurological roots of our social cognition. But what is storytelling? It is a narrative that engages its listeners through psychological realism.

Storytelling is very much related to creative industries like cinematography, theatre and editorial activities. But is also among every task where creativity is involved. And if we acknowledge that creativity is involved in most professions and activities, then we can arrive at the conclusion that storytelling is part of most jobs out there. But as a business graduate I ask myself why didn't I had a storytelling class during university. I would have appreciated more a storytelling class rather than ‘purchasing’..

Creativity and business are as mixed as they can be. Great businesses didn't start out of a ‘how-to’ business manual, but instead business people have always looked at new ways of doing things, always trying to come up with the next big idea, or new bold ways to resolve an existing problem. Business people without creativity are as useful as a typewriter is in todays digital world. (why this paragraph?)

Storytelling is a desired skill, yet not required, in education, in a job interview, in sales, in a executive position, etc. But the fact that is not required might confuse people in believing that they can be successful without it. But there are no successful professionals without good communication skills. And thats where storytelling comes in play, because storytelling is a potent persuasive tool that has the ability to shape beliefs and change minds.

So, if you are applying to university, looking for a new job, or simply trying to have better results doing what you do, try improving your storytelling skills. And every time you have to mention facts try communicating them in a more narrative way.
