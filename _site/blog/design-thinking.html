        <p>Design Thinking is a term that is often heard in academics environments, but its also what its behind products like the iPod and iPad. It is an iterative process for creating new and relevant solutions or new opportunities through a human-driven analysis.</p>

<p>Authors Christoph Meinel and Larry Leifer explain that there are 4 principles to design thinking:</p>

<p>The human rule: a design process is social.
The ambiguity rule: ambiguity is necessary.
The re-design rule: every design is re-design.
The tangibility rule: prototypes make ideas clear.</p>

<p>Design thinking is usually related to ‘wicked problems’ or tricky problems, in which both the problem and the solution are unknown, incomplete or contradictory.</p>

<p>The methods used in Design Thinking include observation, interviewing, creating ‘personas’, brainstorming, prototyping, and testing. Since this process is creative at its core, design thinking is often not fully understood in comparison with other more rational methods like analytical thinking.</p>

<p>One clear example of design thinking is <a href="https://www.ideo.com/" target="_blank">IDEO</a>, a design and innovation company. IDEO takes a human-centered approach to work with their clients where design thinking is at its core. For Tim Brown, CEO of the company, design thinking in business is a competitive advantage.</p>

<h3>The design thinking process can be based on 5 stages:</h3>

<h4>EMPATHIZE:</h4>

<p>Empathize consist of observing and engaging with the user. They are the ones that are going to benefit with your solution or opportunity, so its necessary to create empathy with them. The best solutions usually come from a great understanding of the human behavior.</p>

<h4>DEFINE:</h4>

<p>In the define stage a problem and a point of view is selected based on all the information gathered in the previous stage. This problem or challenge is going to lead the rest of the design thinking process, and it will be set along with a ‘persona’ or model user. The problem should be framed openly to create the opportunity for creative solutions.</p>

<h4>IDEATE:</h4>

<p>This is the idea generation phase, where the brainstorming happens. The problem should be tackled from as many sides and perspectives as possible, there are not wrong or right ideas, so optimism should prevail. The more people participating the more ideas will be generated. It necessary not only to generate ideas from our own point of view but also thinking from the perspective of others.</p>

<h4>PROTOTYPE:</h4>

<p>Prototypes are often bypassed but they are as important as the ideas themselves. “If a picture is worth a thousand words, a prototype is worth a thousand meetings” is a classic IDEO quote. Since many prototypes might have to be produced, they should be made as cheaply and fastest as possible.</p>

<h4>TEST:</h4>

<p>This is the stage where the solutions and the users come together, and all feedback is gathered.  Prototype as if you know you’re right, and test as if you know you’re wrong. Testing is the chance to refine the solutions and improve them. After the this stage iterate the whole process to come up with new findings.</p>
