To change the way the home page looks, and add pictures to the articles excerpts i have to change the file 'index.html'




I have to add a picture of myself to the about page.




I should add blockquotes to the articles.




I just solved the problem using this technique: Include jekyll / liquid template data in a YAML variable?

therefore i changed the use of the variable inside the post from:

{{ post.img }}
to:

{{ post.img | replace: '..', site.url }}
I hope this helps someone with the same problem. :)

'Author: Gaspar L.G.' in the yaml front matter of each post?
